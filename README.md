Game for ex-girlfriend's crazy scavenger hunt.

Play the game: https://assbutt.net

It uses melonjs as the "engine"
Its based on this tutorial: https://melonjs.github.io/tutorial-platformer/

Sprites are derived from images on https://www.gish.com/meet-the-assbutt/ and http://www.gish.com/meet-possubull/
Background music is public domain from https://freepd.com

Do this to run it:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer
.. browse to http://localhost:8000 and play


Here are the instructions of what we are supposed to be making:

```
Angry birds. Flappy birds. Candy Crush. All those other games are so boring compared to GISH: The Game! Build an app game for the GISH App. It must feature a GISH mascot and integrate fully into the GISH App. Full specs for integration can be found here.
```

It must uses one mascot, so i thought make "Adventures of Assbutt" as the name of our game.

Mascots are by year. Each one is a hybrid of two animals. You can google them and find some shit
